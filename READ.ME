Toy project with web scraping, text analysis and pandas. I scraped the discussion forums of a couple podcasts and looked for time trends for words and phrases as well as differences between the interests of the two forums.

With some more experimentation with metrics (and a computer with more memory), could be expanded to compare and find internal time trends in the liberal and conservative reddits. Ultimately, the word count dataframe could be used to train an SVM and give different publications a score as more liberal or more conservative.
